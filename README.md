# Features

# Screencasts

# Requirements

0. [MRI 2.3.0](https://www.ruby-lang.org)

# Setup

For a secure install, type the following (recommended):

    gem cert --add <(curl --location --silent /gem-public.pem)
    gem install martinet --trust-policy MediumSecurity

NOTE: A HighSecurity trust policy would be best but MediumSecurity enables signed gem verification while
allowing the installation of unsigned dependencies since they are beyond the scope of this gem.

For an insecure install, type the following (not recommended):

    gem install martinet

Add the following to your Gemfile:

    gem "martinet"
